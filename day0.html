          It is raining..

After a month of planning and after 100 conference calls today is the day when we all are going to meet at the decided centre point - Mumbai. 
Just to to introduce you all to the the characters of our story, we are a group of 3 families, Papal's from Aurangabad ,Kulkarni's from Vadodara and myself - Anantpurkar's from Mumbai. They have left their respective houses and they will be reaching my place anytime soon today. As per our plan they should have reached at 9.00pm today.
But as we all know nothing happens easily, today 10th of June, it was raining heavily in Mumbai and suburbs. At 9:30 p.m. at night, Papal's were supposed to reach, but we got a call from them and they said the train is delayed by 3 hours. 
After waiting for 2 hours we finally decided to have our dinner.
It is 11:45 in the night my kids have fallen asleep and i just got call from both of them and they said they will be reaching in an hour. 

The trip to Ladakh trip has not even started yet but the tension have already begun.

Whether international airport be functional?
Will these rains affect the flight schedules? 

In the  middle of this, I forgot to tell you the flight timings, it is for 4:50 a.m. tomorrow morning and we are supposed to leave my house at 2:30 a.m.

I think i'll be taking some rest now, and like today, I'll be writing this diary every night before sleeping. 
Goodnigh</p>
