          Maggie in - 5 degree, Check ✔️
          
          At 12.45, I got a call from both of them, and they were reaching in 5 mins. 
          After a long wait, both of my friends were finally here, and good news, it had stopped raining.
          
          My wife and I served them dinner, and we all took rest for an hour. 
          
          We started preparing to leave the house at 2am. And by the time the last person left the house it was 2.40am. We were running 10 mins late on our schedule.
          
          After reaching the airport and completing all the formalities, we boarded the 4.50 am flight.
          
          It was a short flight to Srinagar, almost 2.5 hours. An hour into the flight, and we all fell asleep.
          
          I woke up to the sound of 'please shut the window shields, since Srinagar is a militarily sensitive area, no one is supposed to take photos' and we obeyed.
          
          At around 8 o'clock in the morning and we reached Srinagar, the cool breeze of Srinagar welcomed us. 
          I was seeing Srinagar for the first time and I could sense the difference as compared to other cities. There were military people at every 500 metres. After passing Srinagar and having a breakfast at the local restaurant,we were all set to see the first visiting point of the itinerary - 'the zero point'.
          It had got it's name as zero point because the temperature here was 0 degree for almost all round the year. 
          But well, there was a twist. A wait of 5 hours in the car.
          Yes it was due to a traffic jam caused due to the landslide. Landslides in Ladakh, are as common as Potholes in Mumbai. We were stuck in the landslide for almost 6 hours. 
          Then finally we got to the zero point. And it was pretty cold. 
          We clicked some photographs and we did the most obvious thing and the most anticipated thing too,  Eating Maggie in the Himalayas.
          I guess as soon as we ordered maggi and tea, the God ordered rain for us.
          Fun fact:
          No one in our group had slept for more than 2 hours in the last 30 hours, and still I could see the happiness on everyone's face. 
          It was a memorable moment. We then started our journey to the next place, it was the Kargil war memorial.
          
          We reached the memorial at 7:30pm and it was raining heavily. There were no tourists. But still we decided to visit the memorial in the heavy rains, because he did not want to miss this place later.
          
          But as the fate has its own way, due to the heavy rains the military had decided to shut the war memorial. 
          We then had to get back to our hotel in Kargil.
          
          By the time we reached Hotel Barula it was 9:30pm, we all were tired. 
          
          After having our dinner, we have come back to our rooms now.
          
          Now, I am excited for tomorrow, we'll be going to Leh.
          
          Goodnight </p>
