          <h2 class="headings">Day 2</h2>
        <p class="blogq">Because of yesterday's traveling, we all were so tired that we did not realize our wake up call was 7am.

          I woke up to the ringing of my room telephone, it was the hotel staff, and 
          He said, "Sir, there is a military emergency declared outside, cancel all your travel plans for today." On asking him the reason, he said there's a Snowfall everywhere.' 
          Surely not the kind of news for a good morning but the snowfall part cheered me up. I woke everyone up and we had a great fun.. I'm sure many of us had a dream of watching a snowfall and that day, it was achieved.
          
          After 3 hours the snowfall had stopped and we started our onward journey.. 
          Our next stop was Fatu La,
          
          Due to the recent snowfall, the usually plain mountains had become snow clad mountains now! It was beautiful.
          
          We reached Fatu La at around 12.30pm , the temperature was 3Â° cel. We took many pictures there..
          After that our next stop was Lamayuru monastery. If you want to see how moons land would look like, you should visit Lamayuru. It is called as the moonland of Ladakh.. it is said it is closest resemblance of the real moon land..
          
          Our next stop was 'sangam' .. sangam is as the name suggests a confluence of two rivers, Indus and Zanskar. We could distinctly see the difference in colour of the water of these rivers.
          
          Our next stop was Leh hotel, but on the way we passed through the 'magnetic Hill' ..
          
          Magnetic hill creates a illusion of cars, completely shut,  appearing to move uphill, defying gravity, when they are infact rolling downhill..
          
          Then at around 7.00 pm we reached our hotel, 3 roses, in Leh. The staff of the hotel was very polite and helpful but the one I specifically remember is a guy called 'munmun'. This guy made us feel at home, far away from home, gave us tips for our coming travels, markets, shopping and food.
          
          After having our dinner, now we have all gone back to our rooms. Tomorrow we are going to visit local Leh, Rancho school, shanti stupa, monastery, etc..
          I am already excited for tomorrow.. 
          
          Goodnight </p>
