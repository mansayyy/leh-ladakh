              but to catch up we decided to have this trip to Leh-Ladakh with our families. It was an experience none of us would ever 
              forget in our lives. It all started when we were on a conference call and one of us 
              saw a travel site advertisement of Leh-Ladakh.</span> He randomly asked,"Let's plan a Ladakh Trip?" In no time, we were planning 
              our schedules for the trip. These sudden plans that we make in life, not thinking twice about our job-leaves,kids exams,
              I feel these are the little things that keeps us kicking. So now that it's been a year to our trip, I present you the glimpses of our entire trip. "<span id="dots">...</span></p>

            <p>It is raining..

              After a month of planning and after 100 conference calls today is the day when we all are going to meet at 
              the decided centre point Mumbai. Just to to introduce you all to the the characters of our story, we are a 
              group of 3 families one, Papals from aurangabad, Kulkarni from Vadodara and Anantpurkars from mumbai.show the 
              current status as they have left their respective houses and they will be reaching my place anytime soon 
              today. But as we all know nothing happens easily today 10th of June it is raining heavily in Mumbai and 
              suburbs. It is 9:30 and by now papal would have a reached in the mumbai railway station but we got to know 
              that the train is delayed by 3 hours.<span id="more">
              It is 11:45 in the night my kids have fallen asleep and i just got call from both of them and 
              they said they be reaching in an hour. 
              In the  middle of this,  i forgot to tell you the flight timings, it is for 4:50 a.m. Tomorrow morning and 
              we are supposed to leave my house at 2:30 a.m.
              It is already 12 o'clock i think i'll be taking some rest
              Goodnight </span>

              <p> We decided Mumbai to be our centre spot. We all gathered in Mumbai one day prior and after a whole week of videocalling 
            each other,watching almost every YouTube video on how to pack your bags for Leh-Ladakh,here we were! All set to go! We had a 5 am flight to Srinagar that day.
            We reached Mumbai Airport around 4 am. It felt like the air was filled with excitement. Absolutely noone was tired or sleepy inspite of having
            a super tiring day one day before.
            On the flight, as we were close to the city, those white mountains were ready to welcome us. It's so strange that such moments make you fall in love.
            Not only with the nature,with this planet, but somewhere with your inner self too. You feel peaceful. And so did I! <span id="more">We reached Srinagar at 7 am. The first thing 
            you experience, being a complete stranger to the city, is INDIA. The airport has tight security and no evil can escape the eye of the officers. Even after leaving the 
            airport, there are 3-4 soldiers in every few kilometres. You will somehow start developing love for the country when you yourself feel this. Also we had 
            already started to feel the cold air out there. We never knew what was coming on our way! We had a very kind man- Faarookh - waiting for us with the car right outside the 
            airport. We decided to head to Kargil and watch few tourist spots on the way. </span><span id="dots">...</span>
