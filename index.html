              saw a travel site advertisement of Leh-Ladakh.</span> He randomly asked,"Let's plan a Ladakh Trip?" In no time, we were planning 
              our schedules for the trip. These sudden plans that we make in life, not thinking twice about our job-leaves,kids exams,
              I feel these are the little things that keeps us kicking. So now that it's been a year to our trip, I present you the glimpses of our entire trip. "<span id="dots">...</span></p>

              <p> At 12.45, I got a call from both of them, and they were reaching in 5 mins. 
                After a long wait, both of my friends were finally here, and good news, it had stopped raining.
                
                My wife and I served them dinner, and we all took rest for an hour. 
                
                We started preparing to leave the house at 2am. And by the time the last person left the house it was 2.40am. We were running 10 mins late on our schedule.
                
                After reaching the airport and completing all the formalities, we boarded the 4.50 am flight.
                
                It was a short flight to Srinagar, almost 2.5 hours. An hour into the flight, and we all fell asleep. </span><span id="dots">...</span>

                <p> Because of yesterday's traveling, we all were so tired that we did not realize our wake up call was 7am.

                  I woke up to the ringing of my room telephone, it was the hotel staff, and 
                  He said, "Sir, there is a military emergency declared outside, cancel all your travel plans for today." On asking him the reason, he said there's a Snowfall everywhere.' 
                  Surely not the kind of news for a good morning but the snowfall part cheered me up. I woke everyone up and we had a great fun.. I'm sure many of us had a dream of watching a snowfall and that day, it was achieved.
                  
                  After 3 hours the snowfall had stopped and we started our onward journey..  </span><span id="dots">...</span>
